# muse

Hello,

Thank you for checking out Muse!

I created this project to act as a virtual tour of the Chicago Art Institute.

The idea behind the application is to create a place where you can browse endlessly through over 300k artworks, saving the ones you enjoyed to look over later.

In the future I hope to add more museums for users to browse through.

React.js was used for the frontend, and Node.js/MongoDB for the backend.

I hope you enjoy ðŸ˜Š
