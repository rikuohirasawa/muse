# muse

Hello,

Thank you for checking out Muse!

I created this project for my final project of Concordia Bootcamps, but plan to continue working on it moving forward to make it as good as possible.

The idea behind the application is to create a place where you can browse endlessly through over 300k artworks, saving the ones you enjoyed to look over later.

React.js was used for the frontend, and Node.js/MongoDB for the backend.

I hope you enjoy ðŸ˜Š
